This is the readme for my playground. This is where I expect to play around with code that may or may not get in to production.
There are ideas or just scripts that I want to keep around.

There is really nothing more for anyone to know about this. If you have questions you have to ask yourself why are
you here. :)

Thanks and have a great day!
